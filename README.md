# Kaggle Sucide Analysis Problem 1985-2016

In this problem a compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum. This is with an aim to understand global suicide and take necessary actions in areas required.

### Code and Resources

**Language:** Python 3.8

**Modules and Libraries:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, os, seaborn

**Keywords:** data analysis, plots, graphs, data cleaning, data science

**Dataset:** ![Kaggle Suicide Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)

**Step 1:** Import all the necessary Libraries and Modules. Download and extract the data from Kaggle.

**Step 2:** Check the data for any missing data or data in the wrong section.

**Step 3:** Check data by country and plot a bar graph in data by country. This is to understand which country has highest and lowest suicide rates.

**Step 4:** Check the same for which gender has more suicide rate using bar plots.

**Step 5:** Use a heatmap to check by HDI suicide per 100k, GDP of the respective countries, age and population.

**Step 6:** Plot bar plot for all the year from 1985-2016 and compare them according to age and gender. This will help to understand which part of population and generation are more inclined to attempt suicide.

**Step 7:** Plot a final Line plot summarizing all the data above.
